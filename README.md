# DZR monorepo

Canonical GitHub repo: [`T00few2/dzr`](https://github.com/T00few2/dzr). Production site: [www.dzrracingseries.com](https://www.dzrracingseries.com).

**New contributor? Start with the [architecture guide and Mermaid diagrams](docs/architecture/README.md).** Follow the system overview and client/server technology stack into membership, bot automation, Coach, events, data, security and deployment. See the [maintenance guide](docs/architecture/maintenance.md) for keeping it current.

Three runtimes stay separate. Do not add npm workspaces (Vercel must keep using the root Next `package.json` only).

| Path | App | Host | Runtime |
|---|---|---|---|
| repo root | Next.js 16 site, `/admin`, `/members-zone`, `/join` | Vercel | Node 22 (`.nvmrc`) |
| `apps/api` | Flask jobs and integration API | Cloud Run (`zwiftpower`) | Python, `PORT` default `8080` |
| `apps/bot` | Discord club bot + optional DZR Coach | Render service `bot`, Oregon (`bot-tdnm.onrender.com`) | Node 22, `node bot.js` |

All three already deploy from this repo. Local secrets live in `.env.local` (site) and `apps/api/.env` / `apps/bot/.env`. Do not commit `service-account-key.json` or `.env` files.

## Website (this directory)

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

| Area | Path | Access |
|---|---|---|
| Public site | `/`, `/about`, `/racing`, event pages | Anyone |
| Join / onboarding | `/join` | Public flow (Discord → Vipps → Zwift ID) |
| Members zone | `/members-zone` | Verified-member role or paid membership via NextAuth |
| Admin | `/admin` | Discord **Admin** role |
| intervals.icu | `/intervals/connect` | Logged-in members |

Site reads `packages/shared/constants.json` through `app/lib/sharedConstants.ts`. Next webpack ignores `apps/**` so bot/API edits do not reload the site.

### Vercel

Root is a standard Next.js app. No `vercel.json` is required.

- Build: `npm run build`
- Start: `npm start`
- Node: `22`

Required site env names (set in the Vercel project; never commit values):

- Auth: `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`, `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`, `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`, `DISCORD_REQUIRED_ROLE_ID`
- Coach (optional): `COACH_BOT_TOKEN`, `COACH_BOT_CLIENT_ID`, `COACH_CONNECT_SECRET`, `COACH_TOKEN_KEY`, `COACH_MEMORY_KEY`
- intervals.icu: `INTERVALS_CLIENT_ID`, `INTERVALS_CLIENT_SECRET`, optional `INTERVALS_REDIRECT_URI` (`https://www.dzrracingseries.com/api/intervals/callback`)
- Firebase client: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*`
- Firebase admin: `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`, `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`
- Jobs API: `CONTENT_API_BASE_URL`, `CONTENT_API_KEY`
- Payments: `VIPPS_*` (only if membership checkout is enabled)

`NEXTAUTH_URL` is `https://www.dzrracingseries.com` in production and `http://localhost:3000` locally.

## Flask API (`apps/api`)

```powershell
cd apps/api
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Binds `0.0.0.0:$PORT` (`8080` locally). Firebase uses Application Default Credentials on Cloud Run (`apps/api/firebase.py`). Copy env names from `apps/api/.env.example`.

Cloud Run deploys `apps/api` from this repo. The service name stays `zwiftpower`. Health check is `GET /` and returns `{"service":"dzr-api",...}`. Admin UI is on the Next site, not this service.

Required API env names: `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`, `CONTENT_API_KEY`, `ZWIFT_USERNAME`, `ZWIFT_PASSWORD`, `ZWIFTPOWER_CLUB_ID`, `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`. Legacy commentary jobs use `DISCORD_BOT_URL`, but Render has no general-purpose posting route; [the posting path is unresolved in this checkout](docs/architecture/findings.md#incomplete-and-legacy-paths).

## Discord bot (`apps/bot`)

```powershell
cd apps/bot
npm install
node bot.js
```

Keep-alive HTTP server listens on `0.0.0.0:$PORT` (`3000` locally) and answers `GET /` with `Bot is running!`.

Render service **`bot`** (Oregon) deploys this folder from this repo:

- Root Directory: `apps/bot`
- Build: `npm ci`
- Start: `node bot.js`
- Health check: `GET /`

[`render.yaml`](./render.yaml) documents that setup. Do not Apply it as a new Blueprint; that would create a second bot. `plan: starter` is required so the Discord gateway does not sleep.

Optional second bot **DZR Coach** (silent in channels; coaching DMs only). Create a Discord application named DZR Coach, enable Message Content, invite it to the guild with scope `bot` only, then set `COACH_BOT_TOKEN` and `COACH_BOT_CLIENT_ID` on Render and Vercel. `/coach` stays on the club bot and opens a DM from DZR Coach. Without those env vars the club bot starts and skips Coach.

Required bot env names: `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`, `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`, `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`. Also set `CONTENT_API_*`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and `COACH_CONNECT_SECRET` for the features that use them.

**Ladder previews** (`apps/bot/services/ladder`, commands `/ladder_link`, `/ladder_preview`, `/ladder_analysis`): the bot posts a preview image about 65 minutes before each ladder match, and a match-day reminder from 12:00 Copenhagen time, in the ladder channel (`LADDER_CHANNEL_ID`, default `1382817917984313404`). Teams are added with `/ladder_link`. State lives in the Firestore collection `ladder_bot` (created on first write; denied to clients in `firestore.rules`). The bot has no ladder or Zwift password: it calls the Flask API (`/ladder_page` for fixture pages, `/rider_data/<id>` for W/kg, `/zwift_profile/<id>` for racing score and category) with `CONTENT_API_KEY`, and the API signs in with the club account (`ZWIFT_USERNAME` / `ZWIFT_PASSWORD`, or `LADDER_EMAIL` / `LADDER_PASSWORD`). The route picture is the site profile (`/api/route-profile`), with powerup icons when the fixture tags name them. Deploy the API before the bot. Errors are logged to the Render logs only. `/ladder_ai` adds an AI analysis of how to ride the match (tactics and points strategy) through the same OpenAI setup as the coach. It costs tokens, so each user gets `LADDER_AI_DAILY_RUNS` fresh runs per day (default 5, `0` switches it off), and an analysis is reused for 30 minutes per match and team.

DZR Coach reads training from intervals.icu. Register an OAuth app on your intervals.icu account (Settings, then the app’s Manage page). Redirect URI: `https://www.dzrracingseries.com/api/intervals/callback`. The site requests `ACTIVITY:READ,WELLNESS:READ,SETTINGS:READ,CALENDAR:WRITE`. Set `INTERVALS_CLIENT_ID` and `INTERVALS_CLIENT_SECRET` on Vercel. Set `COACH_CONNECT_SECRET` to the same value on Vercel and Render (it signs connect links and encrypts tokens). If coach profiles were encrypted before this change, copy the previous connect-secret value into `COACH_CONNECT_SECRET`, and copy any dedicated token key into `COACH_TOKEN_KEY`. Optional `COACH_MEMORY_KEY` still encrypts coach memory when set. Optional `INTERVALS_REDIRECT_URI` overrides the callback URL.

Optional: `COACH_DAILY_TOKEN_BUDGET` caps each athlete's coaching tokens per day (default 600000, `0` disables). Cached prompt tokens count at 10%, matching what OpenAI charges for them.
Optional: `COACH_FOLLOW_UPS_PER_RUN` is how many check-ins one scheduler sweep sends (default 100); any remaining are sent on the next tick, until 11:00 Copenhagen time.

DZR Coach uses OpenAI's Responses API with `store: false`: encrypted reasoning is replayed only
inside the current tool sequence and is discarded after the visible reply. The default model is
`gpt-6-luna`; `COACH_MODEL` is the rollback switch. Routing starts at
`COACH_REASONING_EFFORT=low` and analysis tools raise the answer to
`COACH_ANALYSIS_REASONING_EFFORT=medium`.

The non-Coach club assistant uses the same stateless Responses architecture and defaults to
`gpt-6-luna`. Configure it independently with
`CLUB_ASSISTANT_MODEL`, `CLUB_ASSISTANT_REASONING_EFFORT` and
`CLUB_ASSISTANT_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`; changing those settings does not affect Coach.

Before changing Coach models, run `npm run eval:dry`, then a repeated live comparison from
`apps/bot`. Keep the judge fixed so candidates do not grade themselves:

```powershell
$env:COACH_EVAL_MODEL="gpt-6-luna"
$env:COACH_EVAL_JUDGE_MODEL="gpt-6.1-sol"
$env:COACH_EVAL_REPEATS="3"
npm run eval
```

### OBS streaming

Club Members use `/streaming_add` in the DZR guild to enter their YouTube/Twitch channels in a private modal. Both `/streaming_add` and `/streaming_remove` require the role configured in `system_settings/global.membership.clubMemberRoleId`. The bot returns the Lua download, installation instructions and a personal OBS key; removal revokes enrollment. `/streaming_overview [page]` gives admins a private list of members, channel links, last verified live starts, broadcast links and errors. Channel ownership is trusted; members do not connect provider accounts.

The existing Render service serves `GET /streaming/dzr-stream.lua` and authenticated `POST /streaming/obs`; no extra service or provider OAuth flow is required. Set on Render before onboarding:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` | YouTube Data API v3 enabled; restrict the key to that API. Required for YouTube registrations/verification. |
| `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID`, `TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET` | Twitch application credentials. Required for Twitch registrations/verification. |
| `STREAMING_PUBLIC_URL` | Optional external HTTPS bot origin; defaults to `RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL`, then `https://bot-tdnm.onrender.com`. Used in onboarding links. |
| `STREAMING_CHANNEL_ID` | Optional destination override; defaults to `1196454773558345768` (`#streaming-now`). |
| `IT_CHANNEL_ID` | Shared Discord IT destination; defaults to `1544209256100794378` (`#it`). Currently used for streaming errors. |
| `STREAMING_YOUTUBE_SEARCH_BUDGET` | Optional daily search cap; default `90`, reset at Pacific midnight. Set `0` to allow known-video verification only. |

The provider secret names are also documented in `render.yaml` with `sync: false`; set their values on the existing Render service. Grant the bot **View Channel**, **Send Messages**, **Embed Links**, and **Read Message History** in the destination, plus **View Channel** and **Send Messages** in `#it`. History recovers uncertain sends without duplicate announcements. The overview accepts Administrator or the DZR Admin role; give the latter command visibility under Server Settings → Integrations if needed. Deploy the Firestore rules together with the bot; the server-only `streaming_bot` collection needs no composite index.

After the updated commands are registered, open **Server Settings → Integrations → DZR bot → Commands** and grant the **Club Member** role access to both `streaming_add` and `streaming_remove`. They default to disabled (`default_member_permissions: "0"`), because Discord permission bits cannot express a role ID. Runtime role checks still apply, including to administrators and previously opened forms. Losing Club Member blocks both commands without deleting enrollment; leaving the guild revokes enrollment.

After OBS starts, the bot verifies public live status immediately, then waits 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 and at most 300 seconds between attempts. Discovery stops on confirmation or after one hour from OBS start. Heartbeats do not extend that deadline; a new OBS session opens a new window. Scheduled streams and OBS preview do not qualify. Optional per-broadcast YouTube links bypass search; search otherwise uses the daily cap above. API/indexing delays can extend notification latency. Authenticated callback, verification and delivery errors, including discovery timeout, are reported to `#it` with repeated errors coalesced.

Roll out first to one or two test streamers. Exercise Test forbindelse, a public start, a scheduled YouTube preview and reconnect on Windows/macOS OBS as applicable. CI tests Lua HTTPS/libcurl on Linux; native OBS still needs this acceptance run. See [streaming architecture](docs/architecture/streaming.md) for the callback contract and failure handling.

Also test auto-detection for YouTube/Twitch and an unknown/custom OBS service: unknown platforms must produce an `unknown_platform` report in `#it` without an announcement. Select YouTube or Twitch manually in Lua settings to repair detection.

Streaming tests are part of the bot suite. Install `luajit`, `libcurl` and `openssl` to run the real Lua transport test locally (or set `LUAJIT_BIN`); CI provides these. Without LuaJIT, that test is explicitly skipped. Tests do not post to Discord or read production Firestore.

## Shared constants

`packages/shared/constants.json` is the source of truth for `siteOrigin`, Discord guild/role IDs, and Firestore collection names.

- Next.js imports it via `app/lib/sharedConstants.ts`
- Copies live in `apps/bot/constants.json` and `apps/api/constants.json` because Render and Cloud Run build those folders as the project root

When you change the shared file, copy it into both app trees before deploying bot or API.

## Rollback remotes

`bot-origin` → `T00few2/bot` and `api-origin` → `T00few2/zwiftpower` remain as rollback remotes. Production deploys come from `T00few2/dzr`.
