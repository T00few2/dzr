/**
 * Copy shared sources into the app trees that need their own copy.
 *
 * Why copying rather than importing: Render builds apps/bot with `rootDir: apps/bot` and Cloud
 * Run builds apps/api the same way, so neither can resolve `require("../../packages/...")` —
 * those files are simply not in the build context. The Next.js site has no such constraint and
 * imports packages/shared directly via the @/* alias.
 *
 * Run with --check to verify without writing (used by CI). This matters more than it looks:
 * render.yaml's buildFilter only triggers on apps/bot/**, so editing a shared source alone does
 * not even rebuild the bot, and the drift would otherwise be completely silent.
 *
 *   node scripts/sync-shared.js          # write the copies
 *   node scripts/sync-shared.js --check  # fail if any copy is stale
